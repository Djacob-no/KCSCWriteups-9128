# GTA CTF: A looooong (but fun) ride

*This challenge took me for a looooong but fun ride and really put me in the shoes of a forensic investigator. It ended up being my favourite challenge(s) this CTF.*

## The story

The first part of the GTA series was rather trivial. A bunch of new folders on the desktop is about the first place I would look, the Documents folder after that. The PowerShell scripts were no match for an AI analyst, and they pointed straight to the PDF. However, it wasn‚Äôt immediately evident that the PDF name in itself was the flag. So this took us for a little ride trying to uncover a typical flag string in the PDF‚Äîusing strings on it and such. Luckily a thought entered my head: this is the file they were trying to exfil, and the text asks for the file, so let me just try the filename‚Äîand it worked.

Then started the much, much, much longer task of trying to find the backdoor. At this point I had not inspected the `cryptosso.exe` file, but I knew about it. I thought that file was related to the second task‚Äîthe backdoor. As I started looking into it, I noticed it had two versions from the emails. Only one .exe was there, so I unzipped the first version that was not there already. At this point Windows Defender quarantined it üòëüõ°Ô∏è. After dealing with that I noticed the MD5 hashes were different, and neither worked as the flag.

Then I thought that an .exe in itself is probably not a backdoor. I needed to find out how it installs a backdoor. So I started reversing it and trying to understand it. After a while I understood that this file was responsible for the PowerShell script being there. And with strings I saw references to the registry, i checked the `NTUSER.DAT` which gave me little except reinforced my beliefe that `cryptosso.exe` was a backdoor. Then started investigating the services on this machine I saw there was a `cryptoss.dll` üß©. I was sure this was related to the backdoor. I tried inputting the `cryptoss.dll` MD5 hash, but that didn‚Äôt work either‚Ä¶ I was getting frustrated.

### The uphill climb

I spent some time trying to reverse the `cryptoss.dll` (not Googling it first), but I had no luck finding out anything about it. I asked the AI about it and it said it was not a standard Windows DLL, so I continued looking at it. But finally, when I Googled, I found references to it, got very annoyed, and laid it aside üò§. I had no clues left. I was desperate at this point. Many hours in. I didnt have access to a secure environment, but the `cryptosso.exe` that i had restored from quarantine was looking very tempting to run at this point ‚ö†Ô∏èüò¨. Out of sheer desperation and without being in a secure environment i attached it to IDA and hit run. Added breakpoints and hit run again, and again. Finally i gave it up and settled with this file only being related to the first task of exfiltrating the PDF. 

### Light at the end of a tunnel

Later I went to the Downloads folder and saw a couple of executables‚Äîtried all their MD5 hashes. None of which worked. Now i was grasping at anyhting before giving up ü´†, I gave a Claude agent access to the whole system and said, ‚ÄúThere is a backdoor here, help me find it.‚Äù The agent searched for PowerShell files (among other things) and immediately found the PDF from the first task. Then I said: do a system-wide search for KCSC. It searched filenames, nothing. Then I said: search file content for KCSC‚Äîand to my shock and surprise it found a file. I was ecstatic üéâ.

It was in a weird folder, and I thought at first it was keylogger output. I had the AI write a script to extract the search terms from the noise, and I saw `KCSC{its_all_in`‚Äîbut then it cut off and moved to BitLocker and other things. I looked at all the files in that directory and similar directories for the rest of the string. I tried everything around that file that I could think of.

### Back on track

When all hope was lost I thought‚Ä¶ what if the file is just a clue? Then I looked at the other search terms in the file and noticed ‚ÄúScheduled tasks.‚Äù Wait‚Äîthat could be a clue to a backdoor. I immediately went there and looked at the entries, found an `avast.exe` in a log folder, which was suspicious üö©.

That file led me pretty quickly to a set of crash dumps, which I started spending a lot of time on. I tried extracting a lot of garbled gibberish from the crash dumps, thinking it was an encoded flag. After giving up on that, I went back to the `avast.exe` reversing, and upon further inspection‚Äîand also a small detour looking for a local webserver‚ÄîI finally, after about six hours of investigating this disk, found the final clue: a reference to a `keylog.txt`. However, as you can see in the log, it was almost a fluke that I hit part of the text `ylog.txt` as I was focusing on something else.

The rest was quickly solved with the help of the agent, and I thought the last part of the AI log was quite funny‚Äîso I‚Äôm including it below.

Djacob-no: in the KEYFINDINGS folder i have gathered some crash logs that are from a keylogger software called rottas I have an infected computers image mounted to my D: drive. i want you to analyse the logs in key findings and see what you can gather. 

GitHub Copilot: I'll help you analyze the keylogger crash logs from the KEYFINDINGS folder. Let me start by exploring the contents of that folder to understand what we're working with.

Interesting! I can see there are crash logs for both Avast (antivirus) and the "rotta.exe" keylogger. Let me examine the rotta.exe crash logs first since those are directly related to the 

Djacob-no: D:\Users\B√∏rge Malter\Documents\KEYFINDINGS

GitHub Copilot: I can see there are several crash dump folders in the KEYFINDINGS directory, including some specifically for "rotta.exe" which appears to be the keylogger you mentioned. Let me examine the contents of these folders to analyze what information we can gather.

Based on my analysis of the crash logs and forensic files, here's what I can gather about the "Rottas" keylogger infection:

## Analysis of Rottas Keylogger Crash Logs

### Key Findings:

**1. Malware Identification:**
- **Filename:** `rotta.exe` (appears to be "Rottas" keylogger)
- **Location:** `C:\Temp\rotta.exe`
- **Version:** 1.0.0.0
- **Timestamp:** cb634244 (hexadecimal)
- **File Type:** .NET Framework application (uses .NET 4.0.30319)

**2. Crash Analysis:**
- **Exception Code:** `c0000005` (Access Violation - typical of memory corruption or anti-debugging)
- **Fault Module:** `StackHash_2beb` (indicates corrupted stack or anti-analysis measure)
- **Crash Location:** `ntdll.dll` at offset `PCH_0D_FROM_ntdll+0x000795EC`
- **Multiple Crashes:** Two separate crash instances within short timeframe

**3. System Information:**
- **OS:** Windows 11 (Build 26100.6584)
- **Architecture:** 32-bit application on 64-bit system (WoW64)
- **Locale:** English US (1033)

**4. Interesting Anomaly - Avast Connection:**
- One Avast crash report shows `OriginalFilename=rottas.exe` but `NsAppName=avast.exe`
- This suggests the malware may have been disguising itself as Avast antivirus
- Located in: `C:\Users\B√∏rge Malter\AppData\Roaming\Avast Software\Avast\log\avast.exe`

**5. Technical Characteristics:**
- Uses .NET Framework (managed code)
- Loaded typical Windows system libraries for UI interaction (USER32.dll, GDI32.dll)
- Uses IMM32.DLL (Input Method Manager - commonly used by keyloggers)
- Multiple crashes suggest either:
  - Detection evasion mechanisms failing
  - Anti-debugging protection triggering
  - Instability in the malware code

### Recommendations:

1. **Further Investigation Needed:**
   - Search for actual keystroke logs (likely encrypted/hidden)
   - Check registry entries for persistence mechanisms
   - Look for network connections/exfiltration attempts

2. **Your Analysis Scripts:**
   - Your extract_keystrokes.py and related scripts suggest you're analyzing Edge WebView logs
   - This indicates the keylogger may have captured browser-based typing
   - The CTF flag extraction suggests this might be from a cybersecurity exercise

The crashes indicate the keylogger was unstable, possibly due to security software interference or built-in anti-analysis measures. The disguise as Avast is particularly concerning as it shows sophisticated evasion techniques.

Would you like me to help analyze any specific log files or assist with running your keystroke extraction scripts on potential data files?

GitHub Copilot: Excellent! You've provided a hex dump that contains very valuable information about the Rottas keylogger's operation. Let me analyze this data and extract the key intelligence. 

Created [](file:///d%3A/Users/B%C3%B8rge%20Malter/analyze_rottas_hexdump.py)

Ran terminal command: cd "d:\Users\B√∏rge Malter" && python analyze_rottas_hexdump.py

Ran terminal command: cd "d:\Users\B√∏rge Malter"; python analyze_rottas_hexdump.py

The decoding didn't work perfectly due to UTF-16 encoding issues. Let me create a more targeted analysis to manually decode the hex data: 

Created [](file:///d%3A/Users/B%C3%B8rge%20Malter/rottas_manual_analysis.py)

Ran terminal command: python "d:\Users\B√∏rge Malter\rottas_manual_analysis.py"

Perfect! Now let me search for those specific log files on the infected system: 

Searched for files matching `**/*ylog.txt`, no matches

Searched for files matching `**/*exfil*.log`, no matches

Searched text for `ylog|exfil|pastebin`, 20 results

Excellent! I found a very suspicious PowerShell script. Let me examine it: 

Read [](file:///d%3A/Users/B%C3%B8rge%20Malter/AppData/Roaming/Maltis/mfsaofmsaomfosa.ps1)

Now let me check if this referenced PDF file exists: 

Searched for files matching `**/Haaland_Geita.pdf`, 2 matches

Ran terminal command: Get-ItemProperty "d:\Users\B√∏rge Malter\Desktop\Haaland_Geita.pdf"

Made changes.

Djacob-no: wtf go look for ylog.txt instead

GitHub Copilot: You're absolutely right! Let me search for the `ylog.txt` file that was referenced in the hex dump. This is likely the actual keylogger output file. 

Searched for files matching `**/ylog.txt`, no matches

Searched text for `ylog\.txt`, 4 results

Let me search more broadly for any `.txt` or `.log` files that might contain the keylogger data: 

Ran terminal command: Get-ChildItem -Path "d:\" -Recurse -Include "ylog.txt","exfil_simulated.log" -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue | Select-Object FullName,Length,LastWriteTime

Let me try a different approach - search for any `.txt` files that might be the keylogger output: 

Ran terminal command: Get-ChildItem -Path "d:\Users\B√∏rge Malter\" -Recurse -Filter "*.txt" -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue | Select-Object FullName,Length,LastWriteTime

Let me also search for any log files: 

Ran terminal command: Get-ChildItem -Path "d:\Users\B√∏rge Malter\" -Recurse -Filter "*.log" -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue | Select-Object FullName,Length,LastWriteTime

Let me check the Temp directory specifically and also search in the AppData folders where malware often stores data: 

Ran terminal command: Get-ChildItem -Path "C:\Temp","d:\Users\B√∏rge Malter\AppData" -Recurse -Include "ylog.txt","*log*.txt","exfil*" -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue | Select-Object FullName,Length,LastWriteTime

The files aren't showing up in standard locations. Let me try searching the entire drive more comprehensively, including hidden files: 

Ran terminal command: Get-ChildItem -Path "d:\" -Recurse -Force -Include "*ylog*","*exfil*" -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue | Select-Object FullName,Length,LastWriteTime

Perfect! I found the keylogger files! Let me examine them: Let me use the terminal to read these files: 

Ran terminal command: Get-Content "D:\ProgramData\keylog.txt"

Ran terminal command: Get-Content "D:\ProgramData\exfil_simulated.log"

Excellent! I found the actual keylogger files. Let me also check if there are any other related files in that ProgramData directory: 

Ran terminal command: Get-ChildItem -Path "D:\ProgramData\" -Include "*log*","*key*","*rotta*","*.txt" -Force | Select-Object Name,Length,LastWriteTime

Ran terminal command: Get-ChildItem -Path "D:\ProgramData\" -Force | Where-Object {$_.Name -match "(log|key|rotta|txt)" -or $_.LastWriteTime -gt (Get-Date).AddDays(-60)} | Select-Object Name,Length,LastWriteTime

Perfect! Now let me create a comprehensive analysis script to decode the keylogger data properly: 

Created [](file:///d%3A/Users/B%C3%B8rge%20Malter/analyze_keylogger_data.py)

Ran terminal command: python "d:\Users\B√∏rge Malter\analyze_keylogger_data.py"

Excellent! Now I can see the full picture. Let me manually decode the key sequence more carefully: 

Ran terminal command: python -c "
sequence = 'LShiftKeyLShiftKeyLShiftKeyLShiftKeyKCSLShiftKeyOemOpenBracketsITSALLINTHEKEYSLShiftKeyLShiftKeyLShiftKeyLShiftKeyLShiftKeyLShiftKeyLShiftKeyLShiftKeyOem6'
print('Raw sequence:', sequence)
print()
print('Breaking it down:')
print('- Multiple LShiftKey presses (probably just noise/multiple shift presses)')
print('- KCS (start of flag)')
print('- LShiftKey (probably C -> uppercase)')
print('- OemOpenBrackets (this is the { character)')
print('- ITSALLINTHEKEYS (the flag content)')
print('- Multiple LShiftKey presses (more noise)')
print('- Oem6 (this is the } character)')
print()
print('Reconstructed flag: KCSC{ITSALLINTHEKEYS}')
"

Made changes.
```
