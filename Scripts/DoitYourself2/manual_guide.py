print("\n1. Connect to the service:")

print("\n2. The service will print something like:")
print("   flag is over at 0x7f1234567890. just read it yourself.")
print("   btw here is some info for you nerds: CPython 3.12.11...")

print("\n3. Take note of the address (e.g. 0x7f1234567890)")

print("\n4. Calculate the ma_keys pointer:")
print("   ma_keys_addr = dict_address + 0x20")
print("   For example: 0x7f1234567890 + 0x20 = 0x7f12345678b0")

print("   - pointer + 0x28 (common string data offset)")
print("   - pointer + 0x30, +0x38, +0x40 if needed")

print("\n8. Extract single characters - these are your flag components!")

print("\n9. Based on my scans, you should find characters including:")
print("   - Numbers: 3, 6")  
print("   - Letters: C, e, i, r, w, y")
print("   - Symbols: _")
print("   - Missing: K, S, {, } (keep scanning!)")

print("\n10. The complete flag should be in KCSC{...} format")

print("\nAlternatively, run the interactive exploit script:")

print("And manually probe the addresses I've identified.")

print("\nCharacters found so far: 36C_eirwy")
print("Keep scanning around the ma_keys region to find the missing K, S, {, }")
